Turtlebot Object Detection

Goal: We wish to use machine learning concepts to create a turtlebot package that can find and identify an object. Our idea is that we will give the turtlebot a target object. We will create a model to identify that object using data generated from the turtlebot cameras. Finally, we will have the turtlebot learn how to identify that object using our trained model while navigating a map.
